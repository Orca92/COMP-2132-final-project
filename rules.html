                    Hello there! The rules are simple. Both players will roll a pair of dice three times. After the third roll the player with the 
                    highest score wins. Here is how the game will be scored:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If any of the players two dice comes up as a 1 then the score for that round for the player is 0. eg: if the player rolls a 6 and 1, they get a score of 0</li>
                    <li>If the player rolls a pair of the same numbers then the players score is the total of the two dice times 2.</li>
                    <li>If the player rolls any other combination of dice other than the ones mentioned above then the players score is the total value of the two dice</li>
                </ul>
                <!--
                    Take the player back to the menu page
                -->
                <button id="btn-menu">Return</button>
